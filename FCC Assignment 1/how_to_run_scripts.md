```python3 hw011-1a.py```

Console outputs the substitution table obtained just based on frequency statistics.

A better substituation table can be built takeing advantage of  ```most common words in English```. The whole procedure of getting the better substitution table is displayed in ```hw011-1a.ipynb```. 


```python3 hw011-1b.py > attack-results.txt```

This will output the brute force attack results to ```attack-results.txt```, where it's easy to find the right decrypted result by roughly scanning the results.

```python3 hw011-2.py```
 
The encryted results and decrypted result are output to separate files.

Encrypted results are output in two format: hex and ascii.
